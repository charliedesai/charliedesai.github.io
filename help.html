    People all over are organizing and participating in protests to gain the government's attention. The executive branch could attempt to change the supreme court by adding more members or setting term limits which could possibly sway the vote, but this is not a very stable solution. If you are looking to help, a great way to get involved is by donating to a credible source such as planned parenthood. They are dedicated to promoting reproductive rights nationwide, and supporting those who canâ€™t afford to leave a restricted state to get an abortion.
