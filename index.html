What is Roe v Wade?
</h3>
     

        <p>

   Roe v Wade was a Supreme Court Case in 1970 where Jane Roe (fictional name to protect a plaintiff) filed a lawsuit against a district attorney of Dallas- Henry Wade. The Texas law before the Roe v Wade decision was that a woman was not allowed to receive an abortion unless it was ordered by a doctor to save the woman’s life. Jane Roe challenged this law under her right to privacy, and she won the case in a 7-2 decision as the judges determined her rights were protected under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. The Roe v Wade ruling gave women the opportunity to decide if they want an abortion in the first trimester. In the second, the state may impose some restrictions relating to the mother’s health, and in the third the state may restrict abortions all together. This was a large step in the right direction for people to gain access to abortion rights.

  What happened recently?
</h3>
      
        
      <p >
        On June 24, 2022 SCOTUS overruled roe v wade in a 5-4 decision, setting us back 50 years of hard work for equal rights for everyone’s bodies. This overturn left women with no national protection to get an abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest. Currently, it is a state-wide decision as to whether or not women can have control of their bodies by being given the option to get an abortion, and at least 8 states have already fully banned abortions.
